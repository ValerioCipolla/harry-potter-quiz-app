# Harry Potter Quiz App

This is a simple quiz application based on the Harry Potter Books.

At the moment is fairly simple, using 10 hard coded questions, It was good practice for my javascript objects skills, I plan on improving this, by adding a bigger pool of possible questions (possibly using an API??), and displaying ten random questions for each time the quiz is started.

I took a mobile-first approach when designing this application, I have now added a design for bigger screens (769px and bigger), and it is quite a lot different from the mobile design, so I suggest checking it out both the versions of the quiz.
