# Harry Potter Quiz App

This is a simple quiz application based on the Harry Potter Books.

At the moment is fairly simple, using 10 hard coded questions, It was good practice for my javascript objects skills.

I also took a mobile-first approach when designing the page and I plan on adding more features (bigger pool of possible questions, rather than always the same ones for example), and I also plan optimizing the design for bigger screens too.
